When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

   (1) When I want other people to make contributions, or, at least, see it.
   (2) To have a safe copy out on the GitHub site, to reduce the risk of
       losing something.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   To avoid having things change out from under me without realizing it.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When
would you use one instead of another?

   fork is a feature on the GitHub for creating your own copy of another
   user's repository that's also on GitHub.  Used only on GitHub.
   clone gives you a local copy of another repository, which might also
   be local, or on GitHub, or elsewhere.  Used for doing local work.
   A branch is a label for a linear subset of the commits in a repository.
   Used for segregating commits to keep different threads of work apart.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the
remote stored locally?

   You can tell it local is out-of-date, or remote, or if they're even
   out-of-sync with respect to each other due to commit conflicts.
