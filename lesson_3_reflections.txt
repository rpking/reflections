When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

   (1) When I want other people to make contributions, or, at least, see it.
   (2) To have a safe copy out on the GitHub site, to reduce the risk of
       losing something.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   To avoid having things change out from under me without realizing it.
