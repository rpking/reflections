How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Only changed lines are shown, so I can ignore unchanged lines more easily.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I wouldn't have to remember to save old versions somewhere, and I could
    review those old versions to find old material, previously removed
    (like code for disused features), that I now want back.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manual commits might be forgotten, especially when in a hurry or distracted.
    The good part is that I get to decide what grouping of changes makes sense
    in terms of the logic of the changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is for code and a code change might span multiple source files, while
    Google Docs is for prose, which tends to involve changes to individual
    files at any one time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    "git log" will show me the list of commits, their times, and messages;
    "git diff" will show me what's different between what I had at the time
    of one commit vs another.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I wouldn't worry so much about being unable to get a program working
    again if I make some blunder in editting that changes something that I
    didn't even intend to change in the first place.
    I can go back (using checkout) and try old versions until I find the
    version that introduced the problem, and then use diff with the previous
    version to see what the blunder was.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I'm not sure if git and eclipse get along together, so I'm curious to look
    into that for saving versions of my Android apps.
