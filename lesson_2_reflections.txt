What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

   The .git metadata subdirectory is created.
   It holds logs and stuff to keep track of the changes to the repository.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

   The staging area indicates which things in the working directory are to
   be committed next.  It allows you to hold back some changed files for
   later, separate commit, by not adding them, yet, to the staging area.
